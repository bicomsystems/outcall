## What is OutCALL? ##

This page was originally written about the OutCALL application. But as [Bicom Systems](http://www.bicomsystems.com) has advanced and taken steps forward, OutCALL has been replaced by [gloCOM](http://marketing.bicomsystems.com/files/marketing/gloCOM.pdf).
For details, watch the following video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naL7EuwNKaw, or check out  [gloCOM](http://marketing.bicomsystems.com/files/marketing/gloCOM.pdf) features.

[OutCALL](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/outcall) is an
application designed for integration with Microsoft Outlook while placing
and receiving phone calls. The application includes: Outlook contacts
integration, incoming calls pop-up window notification, click to dial from
email/contact.

The [Enterprise Edition](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/outcall-enterprise) allows integration with Microsoft Exchange.

After over 1000 downloads as a free application, [Bicom Systems](http://www.bicomsystems.com) has decided to offer [OutCALL](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/outcall) in open
source format in order to further stimulate development of Asterisk and
related open source projects.

[OutCALL](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/outcall) is licensed
under BSD Open Source license.

[OutCALL](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/outcall) works with
the [Business PBX](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/business-pbx),
[Call Center PBX](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/call-center-pbx), and [Multi-Tenant PBX](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/multi-tenant-pbx) (a [Multi-Tenant](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/multi-tenant-pbx) IP PBX solution) editions of [PBXware](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/pbxware) as well as with [gloCOM](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/glocom) and [Softswitch](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/multi-tenant-pbx).

After over 12,000 downloads on Source Forge, OutCALL has been moved to Google Code.

**Note: [Bicom Systems](http://www.bicomsystems.com) only gives support for [OutCALL 2.0](http://www.bicomsystems.com/products/outcall) and above - as such it does not work with vanilla Asterisk.**
